# Build Augmented Reality game with React Native

Hello and welcome to my workshop on "Building Augmented Reality game with React Native". In this workshop we will learn how you can get started with creating AR game with React Native.

## What we will learn

We have limited time during this workshop (only 4 hours) so we will build a really simple game that will showcase different aspects of development for AR. We will learn the following during game development

- Understanding of coordinate system in 3d space and basic Vector math
- Understanding of Lights, Materials and Textures
- Understanding of AR plane detection for detection of real world planes
- Manipulating models on real world planes
- Applying physical forces on 3d models
- Exploring particle effects
- Exploring AR/VR portals
- Managing in-game state
