# Build Augmented Reality game with React Native

Hello and welcome to my workshop on "Building Augmented Reality game with React Native". In this workshop we will learn how you can get started with creating AR game with React Native.

## What we will learn

We have limited time during this workshop (only 4 hours) so we will build a really simple game that will showcase different aspects of development for AR. We will learn the following during game development

- Understanding of coordinate system in 3d space and basic Vector math
- Understanding of Lights, Materials and Textures
- Exploring anatomy of AR app
- Understanding of AR plane detection for detection of real world planes
- Getting user Input
- Manipulating models on real world planes
- Applying physical forces on 3d models
- Exploring particle effects
- Exploring AR/VR portals
- Using popular state management libs for managing in-game state



## Instructions

### Prerequisites

AR(IOS) 

1. iOS Device with A9 chip or higher and running iOS 11

AR(Android)

1. An [ARCore supported device](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/#supported_devices) running Android N or higher.

#### Install Dependencies

Make sure to have React Native installed by following:

[React Native Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

Make sure to follow "Building Projects with Native Code instructions"

## Getting Started

[Get your api key from ViroMedia](https://viromedia.com/signup)

- Mac/Linux - [Quick Start](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/quick-start)
- Windows - [Quick Start](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/quick-start-windows)

Quick start guide to get you setup and developing AR/VR applications in 10 mins! (No Xcode or Android Studio required)

In some cases you will want to setup XCode and Android Studio to integrate with existing projects for example if you want to get adventurous during this workshop and you finished basic setup, you can go extra mile and setup 

- [Setup Xcode with Viroreact](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/starting-a-new-viro-project-1)
- [Setup Android Studio with ViroReact](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/installing-viro-android)

You suppose to have the following running on your phone before we start our workshop:

> If you don't have **AR capable device** you will still be able to benefit from the workshop. We will do live coding step by step during the workshop and you will see results on my phone. **If you will have AR capable device you will be able to see them yourself on your phone.**



After you've completed quick start and created new project don't forget to put your API key here:

```
// App.js

var sharedProps = {
  apiKey:"API_KEY_HERE",
}
```



Then run `npm start` in project directory and open your [TestBed app](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/develop-with-viro)



You will see this:
